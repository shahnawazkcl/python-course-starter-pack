Setting Up Your System (Ubuntu) and Installing Python

1. Update the package lists for upgrades and new package installations:
    ```
    sudo apt update
    ```

2. Upgrade all the installed packages to their latest available versions:
    ```
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

3. Install Python 3 by running:
    ```
    sudo apt install python3
    ```

4. Verify the installation by checking the version of Python installed:
    ```
    python3 --version
    ```

Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Install pip, a package manager for Python. This will allow you to install additional packages that are not part of the Python standard library:
    ```
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    ```

2. Install a virtual environment by running:
    ```
    sudo apt install python3-venv
    ```

3. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your Python projects, then create a new directory for your project:
    ```
    mkdir my_project
    cd my_project
    ```

4. Create a new virtual environment inside your project directory:
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

5. Activate your virtual environment:
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

6. Now you're ready to start installing Python packages specific to your project into your virtual environment using pip. For example, to install the requests package, you would do:
    ```
    pip install requests
    ```

Remember to deactivate your virtual environment when you're done by running:
    ```
    deactivate
    ```

Happy coding!
