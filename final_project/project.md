Example Project: Online Store Simulator
For the final project, students will create a simple online store simulator using Python and OOP principles. The project will involve the following steps:

    Define Classes: Design classes for products, customers, and the shopping cart.
    Add Functionality: Implement methods for adding products to the cart, updating quantities, and checking out.
    Error Handling: Incorporate error handling to handle situations like out-of-stock items or invalid input.
    Data Storage: Use file handling techniques to save and load product and customer data.
    User Interaction: Create a user-friendly command-line interface to simulate the online shopping experience.
    Testing and Validation: Test the functionality of the online store simulator with different scenarios.
    Presentation: Present the project, explain the OOP concepts applied, and demonstrate how the online store simulator works.

By the end of this course, students should have a solid understanding of Python programming concepts, data manipulation, functions, and object-oriented programming. The final project will serve as a practical application of their skills and showcase their ability to build a real-world program using Python.
